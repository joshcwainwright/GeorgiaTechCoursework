<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When litigation is used to create policy, it can have unintended consequences.1 This is especially true in the data security and privacy sectors, where the law and technology are developing at different rates. Thus, when lawyers and judges do not fully consider the legal and practical repercussions of technology, they run the risk of undermining the successful advocates' original position. Nothing illustrates this risk more than the recent data privacy cases in the United States and European Union. Advocates in these cases brought their claims to defend privacy rights; however, their success before the European Court of Justice (CJEU)2 and the Second Circuit will paradoxically have the opposite effect by negatively impacting global user privacy and enterprise cybersecurity.3</p>
<p>Two cases-Data Protection Commissioner v. Schrems (Schrems II)4 before the CJEU and United States v. Microsoft Corp. (Microsoft Ireland) before the U.S. Supreme Court-along with pending challenges to the EUU.S. Privacy Shield, are forcing this issue. In the former case, the plaintiff, Mr. Schrems, is challenging the ability of U.S. companies to transfer EU user data from the European Union to the United States using Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), which are EU-issued contractual clauses that seek to establish safeguards for cross-border data transfers.6 Mr. Schrems claims that such mechanisms fail to provide adequate safeguards for transfer.7 Simultaneously, in Microsoft Ireland, Microsoft is arguing that the application of U.S. law to law enforcement's ability to compel user data stored abroad by American companies is an inappropriate extraterritorial extension of law enforcement powers.8 Though the former argument restrains commercial transfers of user data and the latter limits law enforcement access to data, they both ultimately impede cross-border data transfers such that data localization is the sole scalable legal and business solution available to U.S. companies.</p>
<p>while these cases do not directly cause the implementation of data localization laws or regulations, they do highlight the irreconcilable differences between the EU and U.S. approaches to data privacy. Unfortunately, these differences ultimately boil down to key aspects of the U.S. legal system, such as Article III standing.9 Thus, if the CJEU and the U.S. Supreme Court find for the original plaintiffs, the United States will be forced to either walk back foundational aspects of the U.S. legal system or put U.S. corporations in a position where they must localize data.10</p>
<p>Data localization is not new, and governments normally implement localization through restrictive laws and regulations that bar the movement of data in and out of a country.11 Such laws are generally criticized for being expensive for corporations and protectionist.12 Unfortunately, the costs are not only financial.13 Localization will also negatively impact user privacy and enterprise security worldwide by creating greater government access to user data,14 minimizing the efficacy of corporate privacy and security controls, and expanding the corporate network.15 The CJEU's data privacy and Microsoft Ireland cases facilitate localization by highlighting the unamenable differences between EU and U.S. approaches to privacy and by assigning a territorial identity to data. Thus, while these cases may provide an appearance of greater protection, they place user privacy and security at greater risk of exposure to good and bad actors alike.</p>
<p>This Note explores data localization as a key unintended consequence of the CJEU's data privacy cases and the Second Circuit's Microsoft Ireland case. It argues that these cases will undermine user privacy and global enterprise security by restricting the movement of data across borders and forcing corporations to localize by invalidating key data transfer mechanisms. Part I first outlines the concept of data localization and then details EU and U.S. data privacy laws and the various mechanisms for transfer from the European Union to the United States. This Part also discusses the EU and U.S. perspectives on standing and notes that this irreconcilable difference could undermine cross-border data transfers between the European Union and United States. Part II discusses the legal mechanisms used for data transfers by commercial entities and law enforcement. Part III analyzes two pending cases-Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland-and how these cases affect the validity of data transfer mechanisms.</p>
<p>Part IV addresses how these cases erect barriers to the movement of data and remove key mechanisms for data transfer. This Part also discusses how localization undermines user privacy and security by providing governments with greater access to user data and limiting the efficacy of data security tools. Finally, Part V concludes by asking the CJEU and U.S. Supreme Court to rule in favor of greater security and privacy.</p>
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>If the courts in Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland hold for the plaintiffs, data localization will be a practical rather than legal consequence. To reach this conclusion, it is necessary to understand how the United States and the European Union conceptualize and implement data privacy protections, including an analysis of key U.S. surveillance programs and redress mechanisms available when a privacy violation has occurred. Ultimately, the validity of EU-U.S. cross-border data transfers turns on whether the transfers from the European Union are conducted pursuant to a privacy regime commensurate with, but not necessarily identical to, those provided in the European Union. The U.S. system is unlikely to meet the EU standard because the United States and European Union have such fundamentally different approaches to privacy law that it is unlikely the European Union would deem the U.S. system adequate. Consequently, because transfers are no longer an option, localizing data will become the norm, rather than the exception.</p>
<p>A. Data Localization</p>
<p>Generally, countries maintain three primary justifications for implementing data localization regulations. First, some countries view localization as critical to protecting their respective citizens from U.S. surveillance.16 Second, others justify localization because it benefits their domestic law enforcement by increasing the accessibility of user data through local legal processes.17 Third, data localization also has a protectionist motive, and countries have used it as means to bolster domestic markets.18</p>
<p>Despite these purported benefits, data localization has several negative consequences. One particularly worrisome consequence is the direct financial burden placed on companies and consumers.19 In 2013, data localization was predicted to cost cloud computing services between $21.5 billion and $35 billion by 2016.20 The majority of this high cost stems from the development and staffing of necessary technical infrastructure essential for compliance with data localization requirements, which can amount to upwards of $60.9 million.21</p>
<p>Further, a long-term financial impact study of data localization in seven major countries concluded that recently proposed or implemented data localization legislation substantially impacted the gross domestic products of all seven countries studied, finding welfare losses of $63 billion in china and $193 billion in the European Union.22 The report also suggested that while localization will increase costs for U.S. companies, consumers worldwide will actually pay the price as companies shift the cost of localization onto consumers.23 Despite the known financial costs of data localization, several countries have still legislated and implemented these regimes. Though the United States and European Union have generally permitted the free and open flow of information, the trend towards data localization reflects each nation's approach to data privacy.</p>
<p>B. EU and U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy</p>
<p>The United States' and European Union's different perspectives on privacy turn on the recognition of privacy either as an aspect of individual dignity or as a function of individual liberty.24 In Europe, privacy is considered a part of the individual's dignity, and citizens have the "right to be shielded against unwanted public exposure."25 As such, the right to privacy, and more specifically the right to privacy in communications, is enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.26 Conversely, the U.S. approach to privacy derives from the concept of liberty and hinges on the idea that citizens should be free from state intrusion.27 Consequently, U.S. privacy protections were originally derived from the Fourth Amendment but have developed in U.S. jurisprudence within the penumbras of the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.</p>
<p>These theoretical differences are reflected in substantive distinctions in EU and U.S. data privacy laws and regulations.28 As described below, the European Union uses a comprehensive approach with broad, overarching data protection laws that expands across various sectors, applies extraterritorially, and protects individuals located in the European Union regardless of citizenship.29 Unlike the European Union, the United States employs a sectoral approach, consisting of different laws and regulations for each commercial sector.30 This seemingly inconsequential distinction is at the basis of the data privacy disputes before the CJEU.</p>
<p>1. EU data privacy</p>
<p>The EU Data Protection Directive (Directive) is the foundation of the European data privacy regulation.31 Adopted in 1995, the Directive comprehensively details the data rights of EU citizens, outlines the obligations of governments and corporations with respect to those rights, and requires that all data transfers maintain adequate safeguards to protect the personal information of EU individuals.32 The Directive is being replaced in May 2018 by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).33 In terms of data transfer provisions, the GDPR expands and clarifies the mechanisms and requirements for data transfer from the European Union to third-party countries.34 However, the change in laws from the Directive to the GDPR is unlikely to have any impact on the admissibility of the claims in Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland because the underlying issues in question are so fundamental to rights guaranteed under the EU charter.</p>
<p>The principles for cross-border data transfers are laid out in Articles 25 and 26 of the Directive.35 Article 25 requires that transfers of personal data from the European Union to a third-party country ensure an adequate level of protection.36 This determination depends on the country's domestic laws, the nature of the data transferred, and the purpose of the transfer.37 Even if a third-party country's domestic laws do not ensure sufficient safeguards, a country can still meet the requisite standard based upon international commitments negotiated between the third-party country and the European Commission.38 Notably, the Directive does not require identical laws but instead requires that the third-party country employ domestic laws or maintain international obligations that create protections "essentially equivalent" to those provided to EU citizens.39 The Directive empowers the European Commission to render an adequacy decision40 determining whether the domestic law of the third-party state "ensures an adequate level of protection . . . for the protection of private lives and basic freedoms and rights of individuals."41</p>
<p>If Article 25 is not met, the Directive prohibits personal data transfers from the EU to a third-party country unless the country meets one of the exceptions listed under Article 26;42 the exceptions fall into three categories. First, Article 26 provides six derogations for transfer where it is completed pursuant to the data subject's consent, is necessary for the performance of a contract, required on grounds of public importance, or legally required.43 These derogations are factbased and are to be interpreted strictly.44 Second, an EU member state may authorize transfer to a country where the data controller "adduces adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals."45 If the member state decides to grant such permission to a third-party country, the state must inform the Commission and other member states.46 Third, transfers may also be conducted pursuant to contractual clauses referred to as SCCs. The European Commission approves these clauses and they are integrated into data transfer agreements between EU and U.S. data controllers.47</p>
<p>Additionally, the Directive and GDPR provide two important clauses regarding law enforcement access to user data. First, both the Directive and GDPR allow for member states to adopt laws and regulations restricting rights and obligations when such restriction is necessary for national security, defense, or public safety.48 This exception allows for the member states to change how data is collected, processed, and transferred whenever the member state is able to justify such behavior for national security purposes.49 Second, the GDPR changes the methodology for U.S. law enforcement to access user data stored in EU nations by requiring that production of user data be requested pursuant to an international agreement, such as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).50 When the data is controlled by an EU entity, this reflects the standard process that U.S. law enforcement must comply with to obtain EU user data. However, this raises questions as to whether the GDPR is memorializing the Second Circuit's decision in Microsoft Ireland, discussed in Section III.B, such that the Supreme Court's holding in that case will be rendered irrelevant.</p>
<p>2. U.S. data privacy</p>
<p>The United States takes a different approach to data privacy laws and regulations. Whereas the European Union employs a comprehensive approach, the United States uses a sectoral approach, consisting of different laws and regulations per commercial sector.51 This approach has resulted in fragmented privacy protections and regulations.52 Thus, when assessing the adequacy of U.S. privacy protections, it is critical to review U.S. law holistically because different protections and remedies derive from different areas.53 Key to the cases described below in Sections IV.A and IV.B are a myriad of surveillance laws and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).</p>
<p>a.Challenged surveillance laws and programs</p>
<p>InJune 2013, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of documents from the agency and exposed section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allowed the NSA to target, for intelligence purposes, the communications of non-U.S. citizens reasonably believed to be outside of the United States.54</p>
<p>FISA was enacted by Congress in 1975 "to curb the problem of unchecked domestic surveillance and intelligence-gathering abuses undertaken by the executive branch in the post-World War II era."55 Since passing the law, Congress has amended it several times, most recently through the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (FAA). The FAA was "designed to provide wholesale authorization for a particular kind of warrantless electronic surveillance that had become . . . unduly cumbersome to pursue on a case-by-case, warrant-driven basis."56 Mr. Snowden's leaks exposed section 702 of FISA,57 which, though requiring annual certifications authorizing collection of foreign intelligence information, does not require the U.S. government to make a probable cause showing that the target is a foreign agent prior to collection.58</p>
<p>Under section 702, the NSA may conduct what is known as PRISM collection.59 In PRISM collection, the U.S. government sends selectors, such as an e-mail address, to a U.S. electronic communications service provider, such as Google or Yahoo, and compels the service provider to share this information.60 The NSA may receive all data collected through PRISM, and the Central Intelligence Agency or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may receive a select portion of the collection.61 Each agency has minimization procedures limiting how the agency can search and analyze collected data, how long it can be maintained, and how it is to be destroyed.62 The procedure is also subject to extensive oversight by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FISA court.63</p>
<p>Following Snowden's revelations of this and other collection programs, the U.S. government took several steps to reform its surveillance programs. President Obama commissioned a review group to provide recommendations to balance U.S. national security with its foreign policy interests and its commitment to privacy and civil liberties.64 Based on those recommendations, the Obama administration released Presidential Policy Directive 28 ("PPD-28"), which expands surveillance collection principles usually applied to U.S. citizens to foreign nationals.65 PPD-28 limits the situations in which bulk collection of information may be conducted and outlines minimization, retention, and dissemination restrictions on the U.S. intelligence community.66</p>
<p>b.Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)</p>
<p>Under the ECPA, U.S. law enforcement is also able to access domestic and foreign user data, including the content of communications.67 Title II of the ECPA is known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and it governs the disclosure of user data, content, and non-content to law enforcement.68 Section 2703 details the requirements for disclosure of user information using search warrants, subpoenas, or 2703(d) court orders.69 While the SCA initially allowed law enforcement to obtain user content via a subpoena if the data had been stored for over 180 days, it is widely recognized that law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant to compel user content.</p>
<p>Two relevant aspects of the SCA are user notice and the use of national security letters ("NSLs"). The SCA, which requires that notice of the law enforcement request be provided to the user at some point, permits courts to issue an order barring service providers from notifying the user of the law enforcement request.70 Often these orders are frequently renewed or forgotten about such that they become permanent and the user is never notified.71 Additionally, the ECPA also expands law enforcement's use of NSLs, which allow the FBI to compel records from third-party service providers.72 NSLs are accompanied by an indefinite gag order73 and prohibit the receiving party from disclosing the existence of the NSL unless certain requirements are met.74</p>
<p>c.Redress mechanisms</p>
<p>The final and arguably most important change to U.S. privacy and surveillance law following the Snowden revelations is the ability of foreign nationals to seek redress within U.S. domestic courts for alleged privacy violations caused by U.S. surveillance.75 This ability highlights basic legal differences in the U.S. and EU legal systems. While these differences include concepts such as remedies76 and sovereign immunity,77 the most critical distinction is standing.78 Though the European Union does not require that the protections afforded to EU residents in the United States be identical to the European Union's, it does require that the protections be commensurate.79 This requirement creates a problem because the differing attitudes toward standing may lead the European Union to find that U.S. protections are insufficient.80</p>
<p>The primary civil redress mechanism available to U.S. citizens is the Privacy Act, which allows plaintiffs to challenge the validity of federal agency data collection, prohibits government disclosure to third parties, and requires agencies to be transparent about leveraged collection systems.81 The Judicial Redress Act of 2015 (IRA) expanded these protections to foreign nationals.82 While the IRA creates a legal cause of action, a key challenge that each foreign plaintiff will face is standing.83 U.S. case law has interpreted standing to require that plaintiffs show (1) an injury-in-fact that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent; (2) that there is a causal connection between the injury and the alleged conduct; and (3) that the injury will be redressed by the court's decision.84 Thus, a party that is unable to make this showing, whether a U.S. citizen or foreign national, will be precluded from seeking relief.</p>
<p>Two cases-Clapper v. Amnesty Internationaand Spokeo v. Robins86- are key to analyzing the ability of foreign nationals to bring claims. In Clapper, respondents sought a declaratory judgment that foreign collection under FISA was unconstitutional and requested injunction against such collection.87 The Supreme Court rejected the respondents' claim that there was an objective likelihood of harm and instead found that the respondents could not show that surveillance of their communications was actual or imminent.88 Additionally, the Court also rejected the respondents' claim that the organizations must have standing to challenge the constitutionality of surveillance programs because otherwise surveillance would be insulated from meaningful judicial review.89 Clapper thus raises questions of how a party is able to challenge U.S. surveillance when plaintiffs do not know whether they have been surveilled.90</p>
<p>A corollary case to Clapper is Spokeo v. Robins, in which the respondent alleged that a website operator published inaccurate information about him in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.91 The Supreme court found that even when there is an alleged violation of a statutory right, the plaintiff still has the burden of showing the elements of Article III standing.92 In this case, Mr. Robins merely alleged a procedural violation but did not adequately show a sufficiently concrete injury.93 Thus, a party solely alleging the violation of a statutory right without a showing of tangible, actual, and imminent harm is precluded from seeking redress in U.S. courts.94</p>
<p>European courts have taken a different approach to standing when it comes to alleged violations of the EU Charter. EU residents need not allege "an adverse consequence" resulting from an interference with certain articles within the Charter "to secure redress of a violation" of the Charter.95 In the context of surveillance, the European Court of Human Rights has also found that EU residents can challenge surveillance programs, despite their covert nature, because to preclude such a challenge would allow surveillance to remain "unchallengeable."96 The European standard for accessing the courts is thus lower than in American courts. While some have suggested that U.S. courts have lowered the bar for standing in the United States due to data breach litigation97 or that the bar may be easier for foreign nationals in the context of foreign surveillance,98 EU officials have still expressed concerns regarding the availability of redress mechanisms because of the standing requirement.99</p>
<p>II. Cross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms</p>
<p>The law governing cross-border data transfers can be divided into two groups: (1) commercial transfers and (2) law enforcement transfers. As noted, the validity of a commercial transfer from the European Union to the United States is dependent upon the adequacy of the safeguards surrounding the transfer. In the case of EU-U.S. commercial data transfers, this adequacy was first challenged in Data Protection Commissioner v. Schrems (Schrems I).100 In contrast, law enforcement access to user information stored in foreign jurisdictions is governed by MLATs. Ultimately, it is the failure of both of these mechanisms to ensure safe, effective, and efficient transfer of user information that will ultimately cause de facto localization.</p>
<p>A. Commercial Data Transfers</p>
<p>To date only ten countries have received an adequacy decision from the European Commission based upon the country's domestic laws.101 Unsurprisingly, the United States is not one of these countries. Thus, U.S. companies processing EU users' personal information must transfer data under an international commitment to use adequate safeguards, contractual clauses, or one of the derogations listed in Article 26 of the Directive.</p>
<p>Prior to the Schrems I decision, U.S. entities under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Department of Transportation (DOT)102 could transfer EU user data to and from the European Union under the Safe Harbor Framework. Adopted in 2000, the Safe Harbor Framework was a direct response to the passage of the Directive and was designed to limit the negative impact of the inherent differences between the EU and U.S. approaches to privacy, international trade, and investment.103 The Safe Harbor Framework is an example of an Article 25 international commitment, negotiated by EU-U.S. officials, whereby the United States ensures that the transfers are conducted with an adequate level of protection.104 These protections are reflected in the Safe Harbor Framework principles, which mirrored key concepts in the Directive, such as notice, choice, and security.105 U.S. companies processing EU user data were then able to certify compliance with the principles and transfer data under the Framework.</p>
<p>In 2014, Maximillian Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate, filed a case before the Irish Data Protection Agency (DPA) against Facebook's Irish subsidiary arguing that, under EU legal standards, U.S. law failed to provide adequate protections against U.S. mass surveillance.106 Mr. Schrems's claim was a direct response to the Snowden revelations,107 and he argued that Facebook's alleged cooperation with the NSA's PRISM program and involvement in continued mass surveillance was a breach of the principles reflected in the Data Protection Acts of 1988 and 2003108 and the conditions of the Safe Harbor Decision.109</p>
<p>After losing in the lower court,110 Mr. Schrems appealed this decision to the Irish High Court of Judicial Review, which found that Mr. Snowden's revelations were credible and that, once personal data was transferred to the United States, the NSA and FBI were able to access the personal information through mass and indiscriminate surveillance and collection of data.111 While the High Court recognized this behavior as a violation of Irish constitutional and data protection law, it also recognized that the issue ultimately involved the interpretation and application of EU law and thus referred the case to the CJEU.112</p>
<p>In analyzing Mr. Schrems's claim, the CJEU reviewed the Safe Harbor Framework holistically and in conjunction with the Directive. It determined that U.S. laws did not provide an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to EU laws because the U.S. government permitted generalized access to electronic information and failed to provide redress mechanisms.113 Ultimately, the CJEU struck down the Safe Harbor as a valid mechanism for transfers from the European Union to the United States.114</p>
<p>Following the invalidation of the Framework in Schrems I, the decision had several impacts on EU-U.S. relations. The immediate consequence of the CJEU's decision was that all data transfers from the United States to the European Union under the Safe Harbor regime were now in violation of the Directive.115 However, the Directive still allowed companies to use SCCs or other derogations (e.g., consent) as an alternative transfer mechanisms.116</p>
<p>Companies were able to use these alternatives until the European Union and United States successfully negotiated the Privacy Shield.117 Known as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield,118 this agreement sought to remedy the problems illuminated in Schrems I and allow individual companies to self-certify their commitment to the Privacy Shield Principles.119 Similar to the Safe Harbor Framework, the Privacy Shield requires that certified parties implement and maintain adequate safeguards for transfer.120 These requirements are outlined in the Privacy Shield Principles and include concepts such as notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability.121</p>
<p>The Privacy Shield also specifically sought to address gaps noted in Schrems I by requiring specific measures for the maintenance of data transfers and storage, providing access to dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensuring accountability of data providers.122 More specifically, the Privacy Shield requires strict user notice requirements, provides user data access rights, and extends guarantees under the Privacy Act to EU citizens.123 The Privacy Shield also created five redress mechanisms, which have since been implemented in the United States through the JRA.124 From a national security perspective, as a part of the Privacy Shield negotiations, the United States also declassified minimization procedures under section 702 of FISA125 and expanded the privacy protections in the PPD-28 to better align American practice with European expectations.126</p>
<p>On July 12, 2016, the European Commission issued its adequacy decision regarding the Privacy Shield, finding that the new framework ensured an adequate level of protection for data transfers.127 While this decision was well received by U.S. and EU businesses, the Privacy Shield has been widely criticized,128 with EU commentators calling into question the long-term validity of the agreement.129</p>
<p>Finally, as a part of the EU-U.S. negotiations, the European Union and the United States also agreed that the Privacy Shield would undergo an annual review to ensure that it continues to meet adequacy standards.130 If, through a review, the Commission finds that the Privacy Shield fails to maintain adequate protections, the commission can use the review as the basis to re-negotiate parts or all of the Privacy Shield.131 The first review of the Privacy Shield was conducted in September 2017; while all parts of the Privacy Shield were upheld,132 the Commission commented that there was still room for improvement.133</p>
<p>Since the EU Commission's adequacy determination for the Privacy Shield was rendered, its validity has been challenged twice. Digital Rights Ireland134 brought the first challenge on September 16, 2016, in EU General Court seeking the annulment of the determination on the basis that the Shield failed to provide sufficient substantive changes from the Safe Harbor Framework.135 This challenge was dismissed on November 22, 2017, for lack of admissibility.136 However, a French advocacy group, La Quadrature du Net,137 has also challenged the Commission's decision and is arguing that the Shield not only continues to violate the Charter, but also fails to provide effective redress mechanisms.138 While this case is in its infant stages, it will likely work its way up to the CJEU, and the outcomes of Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland will certainly impact the CJEU's decision.</p>
<p>While the Privacy Shield provides a mechanism for companies to certify use of adequate safeguards, the Shield only applies to companies under the FTC's or DOT's jurisdiction.139 Companies not falling under this jurisdiction have generally relied upon SCCs, which provide an adequate basis for transfer under Article 26(2) of the Directive.140 The European Commission has rendered two sets of clauses adequate, and entities are able to insert these clauses verbatim into their data transfer contracts.141 However, in Schrems II, discussed below in Section IV.A, Mr. Schrems is challenging the adequacy of these clauses.142</p>
<p>B. Law Enforcement Access</p>
<p>U.S. local, state, and federal law enforcement entities are able to compel user data maintained in foreign jurisdictions using the MLAT process.143 MLATs are bilateral and regional treaties governing both U.S. law enforcement's acquisition of user data from foreign jurisdictions and vice-versa.144 These treaties provide a mechanism for U.S. law enforcement to obtain personal data of foreign individuals held under a foreign jurisdiction's law.145</p>
<p>To obtain records via the MLAT process, a domestic prosecutor, whether in the United States or abroad, must first ensure that the request meets local warrant or subpoena standards.146 Thus, when seeking to serve a warrant on the foreign jurisdiction, a U.S. prosecutor must first meet domestic probable cause standards and obtain a warrant before sending the request to the foreign jurisdiction.147 When foreign entities seek user data held in the United States, foreign requests for user data must first make a probable cause showing and comply with the terms of the relevant MLAT and the ECPA.148 Whether the request meets these standards is determined by the DOJ's Office of International Affairs, the relevant DOJ field office and district court in the company's jurisdiction, and by the company itself.149</p>
<p>While this process ensures constitutional protections for user data in the jurisdiction in which it is maintained, it also creates extensive delays.150 Requests from the United States to access data held in a foreign jurisdiction, regardless of the type of legal process, can take anywhere from six weeks to ten months or longer.151 Thus, many critics have argued that the MLAT system is archaic, inefficient, and needs substantial reform.152</p>
<p>III. CASES</p>
<p>At the time of writing, two relevant cases are pending before the CJEU and U.S. Supreme Court. In these cases, parties are challenging cross-border data transfers on the basis of privacy concerns and the alleged scope of law enforcement access to data.</p>
<p>A. Schrems II</p>
<p>After Schrems I, Mr. Schrems filed a second complaint with the Irish DPA challenging the validity of the SCCs.153 Referred to as "Schrems II," the case claims that the SCCs do not adequately protect data transfers to the United States because such data can still be surveilled by U.S. intelligence authorities.154</p>
<p>Procedurally, this case is unusual.155 Following Mr. Schrems's application, the irish Data Protection Commission commenced an investigation into the adequacy standards of U.S. laws under the Directive.156 To assist in the investigation, the Commissioner sought the opinions from independent experts.157 The Commissioner determined that while remedies for redress may be available to EU residents, such remedies were fragmented. Additionally, because the SCCs were not binding on U.S. law enforcement, there was no guarantee that they would actually be able to protect EU user data from unbridled law enforcement access.158 Ultimately, the Commissioner concluded that while she questioned the validity of the clauses under the EU Charter, she was unable to render a final decision until the Irish High Court or the CJEU rendered a decision on the validity of the clauses.159</p>
<p>The Irish High Court took up the case and reviewed the Commissioner's draft decision. Ultimately, the High Court concurred with the Commissioner's finding regarding the validity of the SCCs.160 The High Court, however, also found itself in a jurisdictional bind because a dismissal of the case would be tacit approval of the SCCs.161 On October 3, 2017, the Irish High Court formally referred Schrems II to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the SCCs.162 While there is no timeline for the completion of this case, given that eighty-eight percent of companies use SCCs to transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States, this case will be heavily watched.163</p>
<p>B. Microsoft Corp. v. United States (Microsoft Ireland]</p>
<p>The final case impacting cross-border data transfers of user data is the Microsoft Ireland case, now before the U.S. Supreme Court.164 In this case, U.S. law enforcement sought to compel the production of two Microsoft email accounts.165 While the warrants were properly served upon Microsoft in Washington, the data sought was stored in Microsoft's data center166 in Dublin, Ireland.167 Microsoft filed a motion to quash, arguing that the SCA did not authorize federal courts to compel the production of data stored outside of the United States.168 The Southern District of New York rejected this argument, and Microsoft promptly appealed.169</p>
<p>The Second Circuit reversed and held that an SCA warrant could not compel data stored in a foreign jurisdiction.170 Using basic statutory analysis, the Second Circuit determined that the primary focus of the SCA is the privacy of stored communications, and thus,171 courts should apply the law of the jurisdiction where the invasion of privacy occurred.172 According to the Second Circuit, because the actual intrusion into the user's privacy occurred in the Irish data center, the court ruled that Irish law would apply instead of the SCA.173 Consequently, U.S. law enforcement must obtain a MLAT to the foreign jurisdiction in order to obtain user data held by U.S. companies abroad.174</p>
<p>Since the Second Circuit's holding, nine magistrate and district courtjudges across the United States have considered and rejected the Second Circuit's conclusion.175 In these cases, the courts found that the SCA did not apply extraterritorially and that the invasion of the user's privacy occurred in the United States, where the disclosure of the information occurred, rather than in the foreign jurisdiction.176</p>
<p>In response to the Second Circuit's decision, the U.S. Solicitor General filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.177 Similar to the lower courts, the Solicitor General argued that the Second Circuit's logic is incorrect because the focus of the SCA is on the disclosure by the company, not the privacy of the stored communications.178 Thus, according to the Solicitor General, the court should have used the law of the jurisdiction where the company disclosed the communication to U.S. law enforcement, rather than the law where the privacy violation occurred.179</p>
<p>On October 16, 2017, the Supreme Court granted certiorari for this case.180 While commentators tend to believe that the Court will side with the U.S. government, there are troubling implications for either side's success.181 If the Court sides with Microsoft, law enforcement will be required to use MLATs to compel data held by U.S. companies in foreign jurisdictions.182 Alternatively, a decision for the U.S. government may undermine the success of U.S. interests in Schrems II because the U.S. government will be applying U.S. law to EU residents rather than EU law, thus increasing the optics that U.S. law enforcement has unrestrained access to EU user data.183</p>
<p>Whereas the CJEU data privacy cases limit the cross-border movement of user data for commercial purposes, the Microsoft Ireland case could limit law enforcement access to user data held by U.S. corporations in foreign jurisdictions. However, the cases are linked in two key ways. First, for a company to comply with a domestic court order for data held in a foreign jurisdiction, the company must transfer the data from the foreign jurisdiction to the United States in order to disclose the information to U.S. law enforcement. If the data is stored in the European Union, this transfer automatically implicates either the use of the Privacy Shield, SCCs, or other tools for transfers. Second, because the Microsoft Ireland case also impacts the scope of law enforcement's access to user data, the decision will be considered in the CJEU's decision in Schrems II and other challenges to the Privacy Shield.184</p>
<p>IV. The Unintended Consequences</p>
<p>A holding for Mr. Schrems and Microsoft in Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland, respectively, and a successful challenge to the Privacy Shield will ultimately require companies to localize data to ensure compliance with de facto localization regimes. This localization will ultimately undermine user data privacy and security by removing Fourth Amendment protections from user data and limiting the ability of companies to effectively implement scalable security tools.</p>
<p>A. Impact of Localization</p>
<p>if the respective high courts affirm Schrems II and Microsoft Ireland, those decisions will advance data localization in two ways: (1) by removing legal cross-border data transfer mechanisms for commercial data transfers and (2) by assigning territoriality to data for law enforcement purposes. On their own, the CJEU cases facilitate localization by highlighting the fundamental differences in EU and U.S. approaches to privacy by explicitly calling the U.S. approach inadequate-not once, but twice. Further, because the SCCs and Privacy Shield are based on the same adequacy standard, the invalidation of the SCCs would also bolster any challenge to the Privacy Shield and make it very difficult for the CJEU to uphold the latter framework. Thus, despite the changes made by the United States following the invalidation of the Safe Harbor regime, a further invalidation of the SCCs and the Privacy Shield would suggest that the privacy differences between the United States and the European Union are irreconcilable. The Microsoft Ireland case furthers the trend toward data localization by ensuring that the law of the territory where data is held controls law enforcement access to this data.185 For practical purposes, U.S. companies must retain data in one country once the data is created because each cross-border transfer would require a new MLAT.186 While the cases individually restrict the flow of data across borders, taken together, the cases effectively erect territorial boundaries and limit the ability of companies and law enforcement agencies to move and access data.</p>
<p>1. The CJEU data privacy cases and data localization</p>
<p>if the cJEU finds that the Sccs and the Privacy Shield are invalid, the United States has two options: (1) legislate greater privacy protections to meet EU standards or (2) localize data.187 Given the extent of the changes already made, it seems unlikely that congress would legislate in favor of greater privacy protections.188 As a part of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield negotiations, the United States revised numerous laws and implemented various protections to increase the privacy protections for EU citizens' data.189 Additionally, as reflected in the Irish Data Protection Commissioner's draft decision in Schrems IT,190 several issues of contention turn on key constitutional differences, such as Article III standing.191 While the Commissioner may have misinterpreted some of these doctrines,192 by targeting these long-standing principles of U.S. jurisprudence, the European Union has given the United States an ultimatum to either adjust basic tenants of U.S. law or refrain from transferring data. It is thus questionable whether the United States is able to give anything more at the negotiating table without overturning decades of legal precedents.</p>
<p>Additionally, from a national security perspective, any further U.S. concessions would subject the United States to greater restrictions than its EU counterparts.193 For example, following Schrems I, the United States amended FISA, declassified the minimization procedures of 702, and expanded the limitations principles of PPD-28 to non-U.S. citizens, limiting both the practice and appearance of unrestrained government access to user information and content.194 These protections are commensurate or exceed those provided by the European Union's Directive and GDPR, which allow member states to adopt legislation restricting the scope of privacy rights when necessary to protect national security.195 However, because it is unlikely that the United States can or will make any further changes to its laws that will satisfy EU authorities, including the European Commission and member state governments, companies will likely be forced to localize data because there is simply no longer a valid scalable mechanism for transfer.196</p>
<p>2. Microsoft Ireland and data localization</p>
<p>Although the cJEU data privacy cases impact the movement of user data for commercial purposes, Microsoft Ireland restricts the movement of user data for law enforcement purposes. By finding that the privacy violation occurs at the data center rather than from where disclosure occurs, the Second Circuit's decision links data to the territory where the data is held.197 This decision creates practical problems for U.S. law enforcement seeking to access data through valid legal processes and incentivizes foreign governments to implement localization regimes. First, the holding requires U.S. law enforcement to obtain an MLAT prior to getting data from U.S. entities storing data abroad, and each MLAT is specific to a country.198 That means that if a company transfers the data across borders prior to the execution of the MLAT,199 the MLAT is no longer valid and law enforcement must comply with an entirely new set of laws. Practically, this gap allows companies to continually move data across borders in real time and effectively evade compliance by consistently pointing law enforcement to an alternative jurisdiction. Thus, if the data does not stop moving across jurisdictions, law enforcement will be significantly hindered from acquiring data essential to criminal and national security investigations.200</p>
<p>Second, because the foreign jurisdiction's law now controls law enforcement's access to the information, countries may be incentivized to formalize the Second Circuit's ruling by mandating that data be held within territorial boundaries of the state. This would allow the foreign state to not only centralize the information but also change the laws and standards regulating access.201 Thus, because the Second Circuit's holding elevates the position of foreign law and puts the foreign government in greater control of law enforcement's ability to access data within its territorial borders, the Microsoft Ireland holding provides a platform on which foreign governments can build more restrictive data localization laws and regulations.</p>
<p>B. Privacy Impact</p>
<p>Data localization undermines user privacy by granting foreign governments greater access to user data, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to defend fundamental rights abroad, and monopolizing the competitive market for privacy controls. Confining data within a territorial jurisdiction brings information directly under the control of a government such that the government can arbitrarily change the rules of access.202 Then, because of the foreign government's access, corporations have less ability to protect users globally.203 Data localization also reduces the market power of user choice by reducing the number of companies in any one particular market.204 Thus, there are several ways that localization benefits foreign governments at the cost of user privacy.</p>
<p>First, the current MLAT system exports Fourth Amendment protections worldwide.205 When seeking information through the MLAT process, foreign law enforcement must show that the legal process is in compliance with the U.S. Constitution, the ECPA, and the controlling MLAT.206 This level of privacy protection is higher than the standards used in many other liberal and authoritarian nations.207 However, once domestic law of the foreign nation controls production of user data from U.S. companies, these countries can reduce the level of protection required for law enforcement to obtain the information, a standard that could be changed based upon a shift in political winds.208 This is especially dangerous when considered in the national security context, such as the Charlie Hebdo attacks.209 Following the attacks, France passed a sweeping surveillance law, referred to as the French Patriot Act, that enables "intelligence agencies to tap phones and emails without seeking permission from a judge."210 While the French Patriot Act may be unique because of the context in which it was created, it is not extraordinary in what it attempts to do. Liberal and authoritarian governments have used national security events to alter the level required for law enforcement access to information. This legal malleability invariably threatens user privacy more once the data is centralized under the government's control.211</p>
<p>Finally, data localization regulations will limit the number of service providers within a jurisdiction and create a monopoly on privacy controls within a country.212 Currently, users have the ability to choose which service providers to use.213 This has created a market where corporations must compete for users, and their key currency is user trust.214 As such, companies that fail to maintain user trust by not ensuring proper privacy and security measures can be pushed out of a market.215 By allowing users to choose between rival providers, the market hypothetically incentivizes providers to employ better privacy protocols. However, in order for this market to exist, data must be able to move across borders.216 The implementation of data localization regulations will likely result in companies exiting or foregoing entrance into markets.217 Thus, choices for users will be limited, and they will be unable to change providers if they are uncomfortable or disagree with certain privacy controls.218 If the number of corporations within a territory is limited, the user must either not use the technology or acquiesce to the privacy controls used by the company.219 This distinction may be insignificant if the corporation employs adequate protections, but substantial if the corporation provides backdoor access to the local government.220</p>
<p>C.Security Impact</p>
<p>Today, companies employ a series of technical and non-technical controls to identify threats, defend against attacks, and respond to network intrusions.221 Basic technical controls generally include deploying firewalls and intrusion detection systems and monitoring to identify unauthorized access or data exfiltration.222 Non-technical controls consist of policies and procedures, such as employment of least privilege,223 development of an incident response plan, and adherence to a patch management policy.224 A well-structured information security program will leverage both technical and nontechnical controls to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to protect data from bad actors, prevent intentional change, and ensure access.225</p>
<p>Localization will require new servers, people,226 and tools in each jurisdiction in which the company operates or has users.227 This replication of systems will create fragmented networks linked to territorial boundaries within an enterprise.228 By simply stretching and segmenting the enterprise network, data localization reduces the efficacy of security practices and tools to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats.229 instead, by centralizing data in several key data centers throughout the world, corporations can implement defense-in-depth practices and reduce redundancies.230 By doing so, corporations are able to ensure uniform management of the systems, scale prediction and detection technologies to secure a higher quantity of user data, and leverage the distributed architecture of the internet to ensure data availability.231</p>
<p>This replication of systems is not only expensive to build but also difficult to manage because it creates non-uniform security practices.232 By decentralizing the governance and response, data localization essentially creates a federated system within the larger enterprise, entrusting each country with autonomy over its own systems.233 As a result, each jurisdiction is able to choose which types of hardware to use, how to classify incidents, and how to administer privileges.234</p>
<p>To better illustrate this, consider hypothetical company A, a multinational company with customers in the United States, European Union, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, and Malaysia. Before localization, company A has data centers in the United States, Ireland, and India, and it manages all user data from these data centers. In 2020, Mexico, Malaysia, and Singapore all pass data localization laws, mandating that all citizen user data be hosted on servers within the relevant territorial jurisdiction. Prior to localization, company A only needed three sets of servers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security staff to manage cybersecurity risks worldwide. In a post-localization world, company A must maintain six sets of these technical and non-technical controls, with one in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By inserting more humans and machines into the enterprise's network, localization not only increases the surface area for attacks, but also allows for new zero-day exploits235 and alters how each group will detect and respond to attacks.236 The difference in response can then be the difference between threat mitigation and breach, with the latter resulting in the exposure of personal records, unwanted public attention, and regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>Additionally, a centralized security system enables a company to more effectively leverage prediction and detection technologies.237 A centralized information technology system allows for a company to have broader insights into its environment, and it also enables the company to aggregate information from across the network to determine trends and identify abuse.238 By employing a "big data" solution to iT security, a corporation can detect incidents more quickly and reduce the time between intrusion and detection.239</p>
<p>Finally, data localization limits the ability of companies to ensure system and data availability by leveraging the distributed infrastructure of the internet.240 Because data can be split, copied, and moved, companies are able to leverage the internet's infrastructure to distribute data to servers in different states, nations, or regions.241 Companies are able to increase both the efficiency of distribution and security surrounding the information by sharding the data,242 load balancing it across servers,243 and backing it up in multiple areas.244 This enables companies to more effectively respond to certain threat vectors,245 such as distributed denial of service attacks, and also mitigate system outages from an attack.246 Data localization restricts this movement by mandating that a copy of the data remain within the jurisdiction itself.247 Thus, any balancing or movement of data must occur within the one network, essentially reducing the strength of the network's response.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The jury is out on whether Mr. schrems or Microsoft intended for data localization to occur as a result of their successes. By bringing these cases, these privacy advocates have highlighted the fundamental differences in the EU and U.S. approaches to privacy and have put traditional mechanisms for cross-border data transfers at risk. Thus, these cases encourage data localization by opening the door for increased legislation, prohibiting data transfers from the European Union, and restricting data movement for law enforcement requests. These limitations, whether for commercial or law enforcement purposes, undermine user privacy and enterprise data security by placing data under government control and fragmenting corporate information security practices.</p>
<p>Before the courts affirm these cases, they should consider the true state of U.S. and EU law and consider the consequences of each case. Though all litigation has an effect on parties, precedents, and politics, not all consequences are created equally. A key consequence of these cases is the fragmentation, which will restrict families, businesses, and leaders from connecting, profiting, and communicating over the internet. While these consequences were likely unintended, these cases have created a territorial regulatory regime for data privacy-a regime that is antithetical to the free and secure flow of information. Ultimately, these cases will make user data worldwide more vulnerable to privacy and security violations by good and bad actors alike.</p>
