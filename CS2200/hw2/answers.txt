Problem 3
----------

The JALR function is responsible for setting the return address to the current pc, and changing the pc to the address target:

PC -> RA 
AT -> PC 

However, this can be replicated in assembly using this setup

lea     $ra, return
br      target
return:

Note. This setup requires a reuturn label, which simulates the address that JALR would assign to the $ra register
